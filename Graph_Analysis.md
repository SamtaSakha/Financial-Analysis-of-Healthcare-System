- Y-axis: Total Expense

### Detailed Analysis:
- Each bar represents the total expense incurred in a specific region.
- Regions with higher expenses may indicate higher patient volume, advanced treatment
  facilities, or inefficient cost management.
- Lower expense regions may reflect smaller populations or limited healthcare access.

### Business Importance:
Identifying high-expense regions enables targeted cost optimization strategies
while ensuring service quality is maintained.

- Segments: Treatment Type
- Value: Treatment Cost

### Detailed Analysis:
- Larger slices represent treatments that consume a significant share of total costs.
- Cost-intensive treatments may involve advanced technology, long hospital stays,
  or specialized medical expertise.
- Smaller slices indicate low-cost or routine treatments.

### Business Importance:
Understanding treatment cost distribution helps healthcare administrators
optimize pricing strategies, negotiate supplier contracts, and improve cost efficiency.
