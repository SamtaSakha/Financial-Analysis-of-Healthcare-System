# 📊 Financial Analysis of Healthcare System 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Winter Virtual Internship Program 2025**  
(Deliverable 2: Tableau Dashboard Project).

The dashboard analyzes healthcare financial data to identify trends in revenue,
expenses, patient distribution, and treatment costs using interactive visualizations.


## 📌 Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations generate large volumes of financial data related to
revenue, expenses, patient counts, and treatment costs. However, without proper
analysis, it becomes difficult to identify financial trends, cost inefficiencies,
and resource allocation gaps.

This project aims to analyze healthcare financial data using interactive Tableau
visualizations to understand revenue and expense trends, regional cost variations,
patient distribution across departments, and treatment cost patterns. The insights
derived can support better financial planning, cost optimization, and sustainable
healthcare management.


## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze real-world healthcare finance data
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard
- Identify financial trends and inefficiencies
- Provide data-driven insights and recommendations
- Align analysis with **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**



## 🌍 UN SDGs Addressed
- **SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being**
- **SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth**


## 📂 Dataset
- Healthcare financial dataset
- Contains information on:
  - Revenue
  - Expenses
  - Profit
  - Number of Patients
  - Treatment Costs
  - Region, Department, Year, Payment Method



## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations
The Tableau dashboard includes:

1. **Line Chart** – Financial Trend over Years  
   - Revenue vs Expense analysis

2. **Bar Chart** – Expense by Region  
   - Identifies high-cost regions

3. **Bar Chart** – Number of Patients by Department  
   - Shows patient load distribution

4. **Pie Chart** – Treatment Cost Distribution  
   - Highlights cost-intensive treatments

5. **Bar Chart** – Profit by Payment Method  



## 🔍 Key Insights
- Revenue and expenses increase over time
- Certain regions incur significantly higher expenses
- Patient load varies across departments
- Some treatment types consume a major share of costs



## 💡 Recommendations
- Optimize high-cost treatment processes
- Improve financial efficiency in high-expense regions
- Allocate resources based on patient demand
